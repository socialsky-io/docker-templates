### 10 TERM; TERMINATION

10.1 Term. Unless earlier terminated as provided in this Section 10, this Agreement will have an initial term of
one (1) month (the "Initial Term"), which shall commence as of the acceptance date of this Agreement, and shall
thereafter automatically renew for additional periods of one (1) month (any such "Renewal Term," together with
the Initial Term, the "Term") unless either party provides written notice of its intention not to renew to the
other party which will be effective upon receipt by such Party.

10.2 Termination.
A. By Either Party. This Agreement may be terminated immediately by either Party for convenience upon receipt of
written notice to the other Party.
B. Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, each Party shall promptly return, or at the other
Party's request destroy, all Confidential Information of the other Party (including without limitation the

Sections 1, 5.2, 8, 9.3, 10.2(b), and 11-14 shall survive termination of this Agreement for any reason.
All other rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall expire upon termination of this
Agreement, except that all payment obligations accrued hereunder prior to termination or expiration shall
survive such termination.

### 11. CONFIDENTIALITY

11.1 Nondisclosure. Each Party (each a "Receiving Party") agrees that it shall use and reproduce the
Confidential Information of the other Party (the "Disclosing Party") only for purposes of exercising its
rights and performing its obligations under this Agreement and only to the extent necessary for such purposes;
shall restrict disclosure of such Confidential Information to the Receiving Party's employees, consultants, or
advisors who have a need to know; and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party without
the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party. The foregoing obligations shall be satisfied by the
Receiving Party through the exercise of at least the same degree of care used to restrict disclosure and
use of its own information of like importance, but not less than reasonable care. All third parties to whom
the Receiving Party discloses Confidential Information must be bound in writing by obligations of confidentiality
and non-use at least as protective of such information as this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
it shall not be a breach of this Agreement for the Receiving Party to disclose Confidential Information
if compelled to do so under law, in a judicial or other governmental investigation or proceeding, provided
that, to the extent permitted by law, the Receiving Party has given the Disclosing Party prior notice and
reasonable assistance to permit the Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to object to and/or limit the
judicial or governmental requirement to disclosure.

11.2 Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Party shall be liable for using or
disclosing information that such Party can prove: (i) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or
has entered the public domain through no fault of the Receiving Party; (ii) was known to the Receiving Party,
without restriction, at the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the time of disclosure;
(iii) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party; (iv) was independently developed by
the Receiving Party without any use of the Confidential Information, as demonstrated by files created at the
time of such independent development; (v) becomes known to the Receiving Party, without restriction, from a
source other than the Disclosing Party without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party and otherwise
not in violation of the Disclosing Party's rights; or (vi) is disclosed generally to third parties by the
Disclosing Party without restrictions similar to those contained in this Agreement.

11.3 Remedies. The Receiving Party agrees that a breach of this Section 11 may result in immediate and irreparable
harm to the Disclosing Party that money damages alone may be inadequate to compensate. Therefore, in the event of
such a breach, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including but not limited to a
temporary restraining order, temporary injunction or permanent injunction without the posting of a bond or
other security.

### 12. LIMITATION ON DAMAGES

12.1 EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. EXCEPT FOR BREACH OF SECTION 5 OR SECTION 11 AND
INDEMNIFICATION FOR THIRD-PARTY DAMAGES ARISING UNDER SECTION 13 OF THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE
LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES
AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY SOUNDS IN CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE.

12.2 MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY. EXCEPT FOR BREACH OF SECTION 5 OR SECTION 11 AND INDEMNIFICATION LIABILITY
ARISING UNDER SECTION 13 OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS MADE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN
THE ONE-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. USER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE
HEREUNDER ARE BASED IN PART ON THESE LIMITATIONS. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

### 13. INDEMNIFICATION

13.1 Indemnification. Each Party shall indemnify, defend and hold the other Party and its officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns harmless from and against all third-party claims, suits, actions,
damages, settlements, losses, liabilities, costs (including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees) and
expenses arising from a claim that Social Sky Platform/Suite/Software (as to Social Sky), or the User Data (as to User)
violates any applicable statute, regulation, or law, or infringes any intellectual property right or other legal
right of any third party (a "Claim"). This indemnity does not apply to, and Social Sky will have no obligation to
the User for, any infringement or misappropriation claim that arises from (i) modifications to Social Sky Platform/Suite/Software
by anyone other than Social Sky, (ii) modifications to the Social Sky Platform/Suite/Software based upon specifications
furnished by the User, (iii) User's use of the Social Sky Platform/Suite/Software other than as specified in this Agreement
or in the applicable documentation, (iv) use of the Social Sky Platform/Suite/Software in conjunction with third-party
software, hardware or data other than that approved by Social Sky, or (v) any combination of the foregoing.
User shall indemnify, defend and hold Social Sky and its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and
assigns harmless from and against all third-party claims, suits, actions, damages, settlements, losses,
liabilities, costs (including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees) and expenses to the extent they
arise from any Claim based on any of the factors in the foregoing sentence, and shall give Social Sky all
reasonable information and assistance regarding such claim.

13.2 The indemnified Party shall promptly notify the indemnifying Party in writing of any Claim; provided
that the failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations hereunder except to the extent of any material prejudice directly resulting from such failure.
The indemnifying Party shall bear full responsibility for, and shall have the right to solely control, the
defense (including any settlements) of any Claim; provided, however, that (i) the indemnifying Party shall
keep the indemnified Party informed of, and consult with the indemnified Party in connection with the
progress of such litigation or settlement and (ii) the indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Claim
in a manner that does not unconditionally release the indemnified Party without the indemnified Party's
written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

13.3 In the event any portion of Social Sky Platform/Suite/Software is held or believed by Social Sky, or any portion
of the User Data is held or believed by the User, to infringe or misappropriate Intellectual Property Rights of
any third party (such portion to be deemed the "Infringing Materials") in any place where Social Sky Platform/Suite/Software
is used or accessed, then in addition to any other rights in this Section 13, Social Sky (where the Infringing Materials
are Social Sky Platform/Suite/Software) or User (where the Infringing Materials are the User Data) shall, at its sole
expense and at its option: (i) obtain from such third party the right for the other party to continue to use
the Infringing Materials; or (ii) modify the Infringing Materials to avoid and eliminate such infringement
or misappropriation, as the case may be; or (iii) upon mutual agreement with the other party, remove and
disable the Infringing Materials; or (iv) if none of the foregoing remedies is commercially feasible, terminate
this Agreement.

13.4 THIS SECTION 13 SETS FORTH EACH PARTY'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATION, AND EACH PARTY'S SOLE REMEDY FOR
ANY CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
